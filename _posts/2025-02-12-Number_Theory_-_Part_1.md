## Welcome! 
Hey there, welcome to this post. This post is inspired by my math discrete math/number theory class in university. I am by no means a math/number theory expert and this course is just an intro to it. This series is meant to help those who don't have any basics in number theory to gain some foundational knowledge. If you want to know more, feel free to google or ask an expert. This course will be split into 3-4 parts and this part is all about modulo. Lets start!

### Division theorem

The division theorem states that:
let a be a whole number and d be a positive whole number, then there exists a unique whole number q and r with $0\leq r<d$ such that $a=dq+r$
